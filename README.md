# Mercury One.1 - Metal Stepper Mounts
 Metal stepper mounts for the Mercury one.1

 These are a self source design using laser cut aluminum plates from vendors like sendcutsend. The center printed parts are non structual. They space the flange stack bearings and have a self guiding belth path around the stepper pulley.
 
 There are two sets of files, imperial for .125 inch plate, and metric for 3mm plate.

 The metric version is currently untested as I have only built these using .125 inch plate from sendcutsend. The metric version will also require M5 washers under the M5 bolts.

 Pin Hole Fit: The current pin hole is tight and may require a reamer. I have also hammered a dowel pin through each of the pin holes. Then chucked the pin into a cordless drill to open them up. The pins are designed to be a tight fit, so that the metal plates take all of the force from the belts rather than the printed inserts.
