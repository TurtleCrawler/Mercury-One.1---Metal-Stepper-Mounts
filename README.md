# Mercury One.1 - Metal Stepper Mounts
 Metal stepper mounts for the Mercury one.1


The DXF Files may change based on feedback, I have made a few minor iterations for my own testing.


 These are a self source design using laser cut aluminum plates from vendors like sendcutsend. The center printed parts are non structual. They space the flange stack bearings and have a self guiding belth path around the stepper pulley.
 
 There are two sets of files, imperial for .125 inch plate, and metric for 3mm plate.

Update August 4th 2024:
* Added 0.2mm offset files, the extra layer is added to the base after seeing up to .2mm of thickness missing in the flanges on some printers. You might need to mix and match offset and standard files. The stack height of each assembly should be 35mm tall, but no taller.
* Added a full window cutout to view the pulley and where the belt is riding along the pulley. A new printed tool has also been added. To use the tool, make sure the arrow is facing the side with the bearing stacks as you feed the belt through.
